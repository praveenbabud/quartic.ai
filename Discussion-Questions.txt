1. Briefly describe the conceptual approach you chose! What are the trade-offs?
   It was a binary classification problem.
   Issues that I addressed were
   a.) Uneven Classes
   b.) Missing Values
   I created 26 models with almost equal class ratio. 26 random samples were selected from the zero class.
   Each sample is mixed with the same one class to train the models.
   Numeric missing values are filled using mean and categorical values are filled using mode.
   The values are calculated seperately for the two classes.
   Categorical variables are encoded using a vector(if variable has 3 level a vector of length 3 is used to encode)
   Logistic Regression is used.
   
2. What's the model performance? What is the complexity? Where are the bottlenecks?
   Recall and Precision for both labels was around 0.59.
   I used area under PR curve and ROC curve to measure performance.
   Bottlenecks: I used mean and mode(to fill missing values) so it must have reduced variance in the data.
       
                
3. If you had more time, what improvements would you make, and in what order of priority?
   1. Cross Validation
   2. Exploratory Analysis
   3. Compare with Random Forest model(to choose between interpretable model vs black-box models
   4. Try to create the model from first principles(instead of using general logistic regression)
   5. Use ROC, area under PR, Kappa to measure model performance
   6. convert the script into a spark job
